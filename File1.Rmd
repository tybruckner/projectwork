## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```


```{r}
spdata <-  read_csv("^GSPC.csv", col_types = cols(Date = col_character(), 
    Open = col_number(), High = col_number(), 
    Low = col_number(), Close = col_number(), 
    `Adj Close` = col_number(), Volume = col_number()))
View(spdata)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
Russell <- read_csv("^RUT.csv", col_types = cols(Date = col_character(), 
    Open = col_number(), High = col_number(), 
    Low = col_number(), Close = col_number(), 
    `Adj Close` = col_number(), Volume = col_number()))
View(Russell)

```

```{r}
spdata %>%
  ggplot(aes( x= ymd(Date), y = Open))+
  geom_line()
```
```{r}
Russell %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ymd(Date), y = Open))+
  geom_line()
```
